StoryGen ToDo
=============
Bugs
    - fix formatting issue with entity header title editor
    - stop propagation on Editable focus clicks
    - Handle incomplete messages
    - previousScenesSummary not working(?)
Models
    - Add default model and override models for specific prompt types
Edit hierarchy
    - chapter to act
    - beat to scene
Allow edits
    - scene location and characters
Unsolved bugs
    - loading scene does not parse JSON data properly (patched by re-parsing and resaving data if needed in useStory hook)
    - adding chapter move buttons wiped out the chapters (can't replicate. newly loaded story works fine)
